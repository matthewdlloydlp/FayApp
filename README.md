Highlights:

-Fully compose

-Compose navigation

-Hilt for dependency injection

-Retrofit, GSON

I added an auth interceptor to retrofit to add the token to requests
Added a session manager class to manage the login state between sessions.

For fun:

-Unit tests for ViewModels
-Compose UI tests for appointments screen

Time Breakdown:

-Basics, Architecture + Dependency Injection + Networking setup, Design theming integration, Navigation setup (2 hours)
-Login Screen + Auth state management (2.5 hours)
-Appointments Screen (3.5 hours)
-Testing (1 hour)
Total: 9 hours
